# A Crowdfunding Smart Contract and Correctness Proof

Making use of the DeepSEA system, this repository demonstrates proving the correctness of a crowdfunding smart contract. This is a **work in progress**.

This branch focuses on an approach where model is set up to only allow successful calls, except the one `revert` case which models all failures - which cause a revert.

The valued work of the INRIA CompCert research project (see

building upon it made available at https://github.com/ShentuChain/DeepSEA is
all greatly appreciated.
